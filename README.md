# THEDRE Epistemological Self-Assessment Tool (ESAT)

This tool is designed to help someone identify his or her epistemological standing through quizzes and a reflexive approach.

## Use this software
To use this software, simply locate the `index.html`file of the ESAT and open it with your web browser. You should be able to use it without any internet connection.
Additionally, it should be quite reactive on mobile screen.

## Retrieving your results
Once you have answered the survey **entierely**, the website will automatically save (or ask you to save, depending on your configuration) a *json* file containing all your answers on your computer. The name of the file is like `quizz_esat_results_xyz.json`, where `xyz` is an unique identifier. The content of this file is *anonymous*.
